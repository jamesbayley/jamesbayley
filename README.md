    I’m a British Software Architect with experience in TypeScript and .NET. I started my career as a Structural Engineer specialised in High-Rise Structures and Finite Element Analysis. Nowadays, I dedicate my working hours to the development of Structural Analysis and Design software.

    I enjoy building lean, intuitive, beautiful experiences that are a joy to use and distraction-free. I’m incurably curious: always learning something new and thinking deeply. I love building open-source software. I find transparent development to be more rewarding, impactful and social. I prefer to keep things simple and avoid complexity. I love talking with  people, building relationships, mentoring peers and connecting mutual friends. I want to live a life of healthy social impact and to help shape conversation around artificial intelligence, technology and work.
